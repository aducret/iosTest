# HelloWorld iOS App

This is a minimal SwiftUI app that displays `Hello, world!` on the screen.

To open the project in Xcode, create a new iOS app project and replace the generated files with the ones in the `HelloWorld` directory, or add these files to an existing project. The main entry point is `HelloWorldApp.swift`.
